# Code Improvements Summary

This document outlines all the improvements made to the flashcard generator application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Dead Code & Unused Imports ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.js`
  - Removed unused imports: `Radio`, `FormControl`, `FormControlLabel`, `RadioGroup`
  - Removed unused `onOutputTypeSelect` function
  - Removed unused `setOutputType` reference
  - Removed unused `deckId` constant
  - Removed unused `useRef` import
  - Removed hex comment artifact

- `src/app/UploadImage.js`
  - Removed unused imports: `Radio`, `FormControl`, `FormControlLabel`, `RadioGroup`
  - Removed unused `maxNumber` constant (now uses `API_CONFIG.MAX_IMAGES`)
  - Removed debug comment: `// write your building UI if (true && true); if (false && true)`

- `src/app/CurrentStack.js`
  - Removed unused imports: `ImageUploading`, `ST`

### 2. Fixed Button Logic Error ✅

**File: `src/app/UploadImage.js`**
- **Issue**: Delete button was calling `onImageRemove` without passing an index
- **Fix**: Changed to properly pass index `onImageRemove(0)` to remove the first image
- **Bonus**: Renamed button from "Delete Flashcards" to "Delete Image" for clarity
- **Enhancement**: Added validation to only delete when images exist

### 3. Added Error Handling ✅

**New File: `src/components/ErrorBoundary.js`**
- React Error Boundary component to catch and display UI errors gracefully
- Shows user-friendly error messages with a "Try Again" button
- Provides visual feedback with warning alert styling

**File: `src/app/page.js`**
- Added try-catch blocks around `addFlashcard()` and `exportToTSV()` operations
- Wrapped entire app in `ErrorBoundary` component
- Added error display UI with Alert component
- Catches errors from both API calls and user actions
- Displays descriptive error messages to users

**File: `src/hooks/useImageUpload.js`**
- Try-catch block in image upload async function
- Returns error state for component consumption
- Provides meaningful error messages from API or fallback message

### 4. Added Loading States ✅

**File: `src/app/UploadImage.js`**
- Added `CircularProgress` loading indicator overlay on image upload area
- Disable "Add Image" button during loading
- Disable "Add Flashcards" button during loading and when text is missing
- Disable "Delete Image" button during loading

**File: `src/app/page.js`**
- Pass `isLoading` state to UploadImage component
- Export button is disabled when no flashcards exist

**File: `src/hooks/useImageUpload.js`**
- Added `isLoading` state management
- Sets loading state during API call, resets after completion or error

### 5. Created Custom Hooks ✅

**New File: `src/hooks/useImageUpload.js`**
- Encapsulates image upload logic
- Manages images, text, translatedText, loading, and error states
- Handles API communication with error handling
- Single source of truth for image processing

**New File: `src/hooks/useFlashcardCollection.js`**
- Encapsulates flashcard collection logic
- Methods:
  - `addFlashcard()` - Add new flashcard with validation
  - `removeFlashcard()` - Remove flashcard by index
  - `exportToTSV()` - Export to TSV file with error handling
  - `clearFlashcards()` - Clear entire collection
  - `getFlashcardCount()` - Get count of flashcards
  - `sanitizeText()` - Clean text by removing newlines, tabs, and HTML entities

### 6. Created Configuration Management ✅

**New File: `src/config/api.js`**
- Centralized API configuration
- `API_CONFIG` object with:
  - `BASE_URL` - Reads from environment variable or defaults to localhost
  - `UPLOAD_ENDPOINT` - API endpoint path
  - `MAX_IMAGES` - Maximum images allowed (69)
  - `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` - File size limit configuration
- `getUploadUrl()` helper function for building full API URL

**New File: `.env.example`**
- Template for environment variable configuration
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` - Allows switching between local and production API
- Instructions for development vs production

### 7. Refactored State Management ✅

**Benefits:**
- Moved image upload logic to custom hook (`useImageUpload`)
- Moved flashcard collection logic to custom hook (`useFlashcardCollection`)
- Reduced complexity in `page.js` main component
- Improved code reusability
- Better separation of concerns

### 8. Updated Metadata ✅

**File: `src/app/layout.js`**
- Changed title from "Create Next App" to "Flashcard Generator"
- Updated description to reflect actual app functionality

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before & After

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Dead code | Multiple unused imports and functions | All removed |
| Error handling | No error handling | Try-catch + Error Boundary |
| Loading feedback | No indication of processing | Loading spinner + disabled buttons |
| State management | All in page.js (complex) | Split into custom hooks |
| API endpoint | Hardcoded localhost | Configurable via environment variables |
| Button logic | Delete button broken | Properly removes images |
| Component props | Many unused props passed | Clean, minimal props |

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Error Handling**
   - Disconnect from network and try uploading image
   - Verify error message displays correctly
   - Verify "Try Again" button works in Error Boundary

2. **Test Loading States**
   - Upload large image to see loading spinner
   - Verify buttons are disabled during loading
   - Verify buttons re-enable after completion

3. **Test API Configuration**
   - Create `.env.local` with custom `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
   - Verify app uses the configured URL
   - Test with both local and production endpoints

4. **Test Flashcard Collection**
   - Add multiple flashcards
   - Verify export works with correct TSV format
   - Test error when no flashcards exist

5. **Test Image Upload**
   - Upload and delete images
   - Verify delete button only removes current image
   - Test with multiple image uploads

## Migration Notes

To use these improvements:

1. Install/update dependencies if needed
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure if needed
3. The app should work immediately without changes (defaults to localhost:8000)
4. To use production API: set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` in `.env.local`

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for custom hooks
- Add integration tests for error scenarios
- Consider adding toast notifications for success messages
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Implement flashcard editing/deletion
- Add data persistence to localStorage
- Implement deck management system
